# sound-based-bird-identification-system
This project is a Sound-Based Bird Identification System using a Raspberry Pi to record and identify bird species by analyzing their sounds. It helps birdwatchers and visually impaired individuals study birds where visual identification is difficult, making it a valuable tool for research, education, and conservation.
