# sound-based-bird-identification-system
This project is a Sound-Based Bird Identification System using a Raspberry Pi to record and identify bird species by analyzing their sounds. It helps birdwatchers and visually impaired individuals study birds where visual identification is difficult, making it a valuable tool for research, education, and conservation.

## Features

- **Real-Time Sound Analysis**: Records and identifies bird species based on their vocalizations.
- **Accessibility**: Supports visually impaired individuals in learning about birds through sound.
- **Research and Education**: Aids in studies related to bird behavior, migration, and climate change.
- **Easy Setup**: Requires only a Raspberry Pi and a microphone to operate.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (any model with USB ports)
- USB Microphone
- Bird identification software (to be specified)
- Internet connection (optional for software updates)

## Installation

1. **Set Up Raspberry Pi**:
    Install the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS on your device.
   - Configure libraries and ML models on Raspberry Pi for running the application.
   - Integrate with a user interface (UI) for enhanced accessibility and ease of use.
   - Connect the USB microphone.
